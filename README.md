# Canarytoken Honeypot

## Overview
This project demonstrates the use of **Canarytokens** to detect unauthorized access to a web resource. When a **Canarytoken** is triggered, an alert is sent, helping to identify potential security threats.

## Steps to Create the Canarytoken
1. Visit [Canarytokens](https://canarytokens.org/).
2. Create a new token (e.g., HTTP URL).
3. Set up alert options (e.g., email notifications).
4. Deploy the token on your website or system.
5. Monitor for alerts when the token is triggered.

## Tools Used
- **Canarytokens**: To create and manage honeypots.
